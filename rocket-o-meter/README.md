Am I rocket enough?

## Project Overview
The "rocket-o-meter" is a fun web-based game that challenges users to launch an emoji rocket by pressing the space bar as fast as possible for 10 seconds. The game features a gauge that displays "Are you enough rocket?" on a scale from 1 to 10, which is calculated based on the number of launches.
